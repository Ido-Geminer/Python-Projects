I created a Python GUI using Tkinter to collect user credentials (username, ID, password) via a submit button and automate interactions with Moodle via Selenium WebDriver.
The app checks for valid input, shows error messages, and automates form submission, so users donâ€™t have to search for Moodle and enter the login page manually each time.
It uses Chrome WebDriver for automation, streamlining the login process.
